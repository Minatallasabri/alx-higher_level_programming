* This About The Task 

# Fetching Internet Resources with urllib

To fetch internet resources using the Python package `urllib`, you can use the `urlopen()` function. It allows you to open URLs and retrieve the data.

# Decoding urllib Body Response

To decode the body response obtained from `urllib`, you can use the `decode()` method. It converts the response from bytes to a string.

# Using the Python package requests

The Python package `requests` provides a simpler alternative to `urllib` for making HTTP requests. It offers a more user-friendly interface and handles many common tasks.

# Making HTTP GET Request

To make an HTTP GET request, you can use the `requests.get()` method. It sends a GET request to the specified URL and returns the response.

# Making HTTP POST/PUT/etc. Request

To make HTTP POST, PUT, or other types of requests, you can use the corresponding methods provided by the `requests` package, such as `requests.post()` or `requests.put()`.

# Fetching JSON Resources

To fetch JSON resources, you can use the `requests.get()` method to retrieve the JSON data from the specified URL. You can then use the `json()` method to parse the JSON response.

# Manipulating Data from an External Service

To manipulate data from an external service, you can use the `requests` package to fetch the data and then perform any necessary data manipulation using Python's built-in data manipulation capabilities.
